## Bio4j

Bio4j is a bioinformatics graph based DB including most data available in [**Uniprot KB**](http://www.uniprot.org/) (SwissProt + Trembl), [**Gene Ontology**](http://www.geneontology.org/) (GO), [**UniRef**](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniref/) (50,90,100), [**RefSeq**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/), [**NCBI Taxonomy**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/), and [**Expasy Enzyme DB**](http://enzyme.expasy.org/). 

Bio4j provides a completely new and powerful **framework for protein related information querying and management**. 
Since it relies on a high-performance graph engine, data is stored in a way that semantically represents its own structure. 
On the contrary, traditional relational databases must flatten the data they represent into tables, creating _artificial_ ids in order to connect the different tuples; which can in some cases eventually lead to domain models that have almost nothing to do with the actual structure of data.


### Scalability

* First of all, Bio4j has an [**Abstract Domain Model**](https://github.com/bio4j/bio4j), which allows you to use it without binding to a particular backend implementation.

* Next, it has an intermediate [**Blueprints layer**](https://github.com/bio4j/blueprints), which allows us to make a default implementation of the abstract interface using [Tinkerpop Blueprints API](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki) and at the same time stay independent from the choice of database technology.

* And finally, there are technology specific versions:
  - [**Titan DB implementation**](https://github.com/bio4j/titandb)
  - [**Neo4j DB implementation**](https://github.com/bio4j/neo4jdb)

### Modularity

Bio4j includes a few different data sources and you may not always be interested in having all of them together. Thatâ€™s why the importing process is modular and customizable, allowing you to import just the data you are interested in.

Also, Bio4j has [Statika-based module system](https://github.com/bio4j/modules), which dramatically simplifies the process of building and deploying custom releases of Bio4j.

### Performance

In Bio4j data is organized in a way semantically equivalent to what it represents thanks to the graph structure. That means that queries which would even be impossible to perform with a standard Relational DB, can be feasible with Bio4j obtaining good performance results.

###  Licensing

Bio4j is an **open source** platform released under [**AGPLv3**](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).
